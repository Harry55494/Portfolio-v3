    <p class="ml-0.5">Hey! My name's Harrison and I work in Digital Forensics for Thames Valley Police.</p>

    <p class="mt-2 ml-0.5">I'm a big believer in self-hosting, privacy, the power of open-source, and the idea that no problem can't be fixed without enough time and if/else statements.</p>

    <h3 id="work" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Work</h3>

    <p class="mt-2 ml-0.5">I currently work for Thames Valley Police in the Digital Forensics department.</p>

    <p class="mt-2 ml-0.5">Outside of working for Thames Valley Police, I also work part-time for Daylight CPT, providing Microsoft 365 support, device management, and various other technical services.</p>

    <p class="mt-2 ml-0.5">When not working, I'm usually programming (see my projects <a class="underline text-blue-500" href="/projects">here</a>) or tinkering with something (see below!).</p>

    <h3 id="homelab" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Homelab</h3>

    <p class="mt-2 ml-0.5">I'm a big believer in the power of open-source, self-hosting, and decreasing reliance on the cloud. I run a multi-site Homelab, which provides a lot of the services I use everyday. The underlying foundation of this is 2x Proxmox-VE servers, with a virtualised TrueNAS system, and Tailscale to join everything together. Some of the services I run include:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc sm:list-inside sm:ml-5 ml-4 mt-4">
        <li>Nextcloud</li>
        <li>Paperless</li>
        <li>Immich</li>
        <li>Gitea</li>
        <li>Home Assistant</li>
        <li>+ approximately 15 others</li>
    </ul>


    <h3 id="tools" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Tools/Setup</h3>

    <p class="mt-2 ml-0.5">I love to play around with different tools, all in the over-optimistic aim to get the perfect/most efficient setup. As of writing (Nov 2025) I have settled on the following:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc sm:list-inside sm:ml-5 ml-4 mt-4">
        <li><strong>MacOS / Fedora Linux</strong>. One for productivity + stability, one for games + tinkering.</li>
        <li><strong>Firefox / Thunderbird</strong> - Browser/Email Clients. Great open source tools that don't harvest data.</li>
        <li><strong>Obsidian</strong> - Note taking. Big believer in the power of Markdown and keeping things simple, hence Obsidian is a great choice.</li>
        <li><strong>JetBrains suite</strong> - Code Editor. Highly addictive, and 'it just works'.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="external" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">External Links</h3>

    <ul class="flex flex-col gap-1 list-disc list-inside ml-1">
        {#each Object.entries(external_links) as [heading, id]}
            <li><a class="underline text-blue-500 " href={id} target="_blank">{heading}</a></li>
        {/each}
    </ul>
